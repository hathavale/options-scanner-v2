# Price Display Fix - PMCP Issue

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Issue:** PMCP (Poor Man's Covered Put) showing wrong/missing current stock price

---

## 🐛 Problem Description

When scanning for PMCP opportunities, the current stock price was not displaying correctly in the results cards. The price field was showing as `undefined` or `NaN`.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The issue was a **field name mismatch** between the backend and frontend:

### Backend (app.py) - What was returned:
```python
opportunities.append({
    "symbol": symbol,
    "price": price,              # ❌ Frontend expected "underlying_price"
    "leaps_cost": leaps_cost,    # ❌ Frontend expected "leaps_price"
    "short_premium": short_premium, # ❌ Frontend expected "short_price"
    ...
})
```

### Frontend (index.html) - What was expected:
```javascript
// Display current stock price
<div class="card-price">$${safeFixed(opp.underlying_price, 2)}</div>

// Display LEAPS price
<span class="leg-value">$${safeFixed(opp.leaps_price, 2)}</span>

// Display short price
<span class="leg-value">$${safeFixed(opp.short_price, 2)}</span>
```

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Added the missing frontend-compatible field names to the backend response:

### Changes Made to `app.py` (Line ~338):

```python
opportunities.append({
    "symbol": symbol,
    "price": price,
    "underlying_price": price,        # ✅ Added for frontend compatibility
    "leaps_exp": leaps_exp,
    "leaps_strike": leaps_strike,
    "leaps_cost": leaps_cost,
    "leaps_price": leaps_ask,         # ✅ Added for frontend display
    "leaps_delta": leaps_delta,
    "leaps_oi": leaps_oi,
    "leaps_volume": leaps_volume,
    "short_exp": short_exp,
    "short_strike": short_strike,
    "short_premium": short_premium,
    "short_price": short_bid,         # ✅ Added for frontend display
    "short_delta": short_delta,
    "short_iv": short_iv,
    "short_oi": short_oi,
    "short_volume": short_volume,
    "net_debit": net_debit,
    "net_debit_pct": net_debit_pct * 100,
    "roc_pct": roc_pct,
    "pop_pct": pop_pct,
    "position_delta": position_delta,
    "breakeven": breakeven,
    "type_of_trade": type_of_trade
})
```

### Fields Added:
1. **`underlying_price`** - Current stock price (duplicate of `price` for frontend)
2. **`leaps_price`** - LEAPS ask price (same as `leaps_ask`)
3. **`short_price`** - Short bid price (same as `short_bid`)

## 🎯 Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Current stock price: `undefined` or `NaN`
- ❌ LEAPS price: `undefined` or `NaN`
- ❌ Short price: `undefined` or `NaN`
- ❌ Results cards looked broken

### After Fix:
- ✅ Current stock price displays correctly (e.g., `$218.09`)
- ✅ LEAPS price displays correctly
- ✅ Short price displays correctly
- ✅ All result cards show complete information

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Case: AMD PMCP Scan

**Before Fix:**
```
Symbol: AMD
Current Price: undefined ❌
LEAPS Price: undefined ❌
Short Credit: undefined ❌
```

**After Fix:**
```
Symbol: AMD
Current Price: $218.09 ✅
LEAPS Price: $9.45 ✅
Short Credit: $0.85 ✅
```

**Terminal Logs Confirm:**
```
INFO:__main__:💰 AMD price: $218.09
INFO:__main__:📊 Fetched 2978 options for AMD
INFO:__main__:🔍 find_leaps: Looking for option_type='put'

   - Added `leaps_price` field
   - Added `short_price` field

- ✅ Tested with AMD PMCP scan
- ✅ Prices displaying correctly

### GitHub:

- ✅ Pushed to `origin/main`
- ✅ Commit message: "Fix: Add missing frontend fields (underlying_price, leaps_price, short_price) for proper display"

### Heroku:
- ✅ Deployed: Release v6
- ✅ Build succeeded
- ✅ Live at: https://options-scanner-v2-78b74c58ddef.herokuapp.com/

## 🔄 Backwards Compatibility

The fix is **fully backwards compatible**:
- ✅ Old field names (`price`, `leaps_cost`, `short_premium`) still present
- ✅ New field names (`underlying_price`, `leaps_price`, `short_price`) added
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Both PMCC and PMCP work correctly

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify field names** between frontend and backend match
2. **Check frontend console** for `undefined` values during testing
3. **Test both strategies** (PMCC and PMCP) after any changes
4. **Add debug logging** to verify API responses contain expected data
