# Price Accuracy Investigation

## Issue Summary
User reported app consistently showing $218.09 (previous day's close) instead of current price.

## Findings

### ‚úÖ API Response Verified
Direct Alpha Vantage API call confirms correct data:
```json
{
  "Global Quote": {
    "05. price": "238.6000",        ‚Üê CURRENT PRICE (correct)
    "08. previous close": "218.0900" ‚Üê PREVIOUS CLOSE (what user is seeing)
  }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Code Logic Verified
The `fetch_last_price()` function in `app.py` **correctly** extracts:
```python
return float(payload["Global Quote"]["05. price"])  # Returns 238.60
```

### ‚úÖ Test Confirmed
Standalone test (`test_price.py`) proves the API and code both return $238.60.

## Possible Causes

Since the code is correct, the issue must be one of:

1. **Browser Cache** üîÑ
   - Old scan results cached in browser
   - Solution: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)

2. **Old Scan Results** üìÖ
   - Looking at results from a previous scan (run yesterday Oct 14)
   - Solution: Run a **new fresh scan** for AMD

3. **Database Cache** üíæ
   - If options data was stored in database with old prices
   - Solution: Force re-fetch from API (not from database)

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
1. In your browser, press **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows)
2. Or open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí Check "Disable cache"

### Step 2: Run Fresh Scan
1. Restart the Flask app (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/herambhathavale/jupyterDir2/Oct-12-2025-Options-Scanner-v2/options-scanner-v2
   export DATABASE_URL=$(grep DATABASE_URL .env | cut -d '=' -f2-)
   export ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=$(grep ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY .env | cut -d '=' -f2-)
   python3 app.py
   ```

2. Open browser to http://127.0.0.1:5001

3. In the scan form:
   - Symbol: **AMD**
   - Strategy: **PMCP** (Poor Man's Covered Put)
   - Click **"Run Scan"**

4. Watch the terminal output for:
   ```
   üîç DEBUG AMD: Current Price='05. price'=238.6, Previous Close='08. previous close'=218.09
   üí∞ AMD price: $238.60
   ```

5. Check the browser results - the price should now show **$238.60**

### Step 3: Verify Results
- ‚úÖ If you see $238.60 ‚Üí Issue was browser cache or old results
- ‚ùå If you still see $218.09 ‚Üí Report back with terminal logs

## Debug Logging Added
The following debug line was added to `fetch_last_price()` at line ~70:
```python
logger.info(f"üîç DEBUG {symbol}: Current Price='05. price'={current_price}, Previous Close='08. previous close'={previous_close}")
```

This will show in terminal output during scans to confirm which value is being extracted.

## Next Steps
**Please run a fresh scan following Step 2 above and report:**
1. What price shows in the browser UI?
2. What the terminal logs show (especially the üîç DEBUG line)?
3. Screenshot of the results page would be helpful

This will help determine if it's a caching issue or something else.
