# Poor Man's Covered Put (PMCP) Support - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Feature:** Added full support for Poor Man's Covered Put strategy alongside existing Poor Man's Covered Call

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Support** ✓
- **Column:** `type_of_trade` VARCHAR already exists in `strategy_filter_criteria` table
- **Constraint Added:** Database constraint ensures only valid strategy types:
  - `'Poor Mans Covered Call'` (PMCC)
  - `'Poor Mans Covered Put'` (PMCP)
- **Migration File:** `migration_add_strategy_constraint.sql` created and executed successfully

### 2. **Backend Logic** ✓ (Already Existed)
The backend in `app.py` already had full support for both strategies:

```python
# Line 253-255 in app.py
option_type = "call" if type_of_trade == 'Poor Mans Covered Call' else "put"
leaps_target_delta = 0.8 if option_type == "call" else -0.8
short_target_delta = 0.3 if option_type == "call" else -0.3
```

**How It Works:**
- For **PMCC**: Scans for call options with positive deltas (0.8 for LEAPS, 0.3 for short)
- For **PMCP**: Scans for put options with negative deltas (-0.8 for LEAPS, -0.3 for short)
- All ITM/OTM calculations, probability of profit, and ROC metrics automatically adjust

### 3. **User Interface Enhancements** ✓ (NEW)

#### A. Prominent Strategy Selector
- **Location:** Top of filter configuration (before LEAPS criteria)
- **Design:** Purple gradient banner with large, clear dropdown
- **Options:**
  - 📈 Poor Man's Covered Call (PMCC) - Bullish
  - 📉 Poor Man's Covered Put (PMCP) - Bearish
- **Description:** Real-time strategy description updates based on selection

#### B. Dynamic Label Updates
JavaScript function `updateStrategyLabels()` automatically updates:
- **LEAPS Section:** "Long Call (LEAPS)" ↔ "Long Put (LEAPS)"
- **Short Section:** "Short Call" ↔ "Short Put"
- **Strategy Description:** Bullish/Bearish context

#### C. Opportunity Cards
Each result card now displays:
- Strategy badge (PMCC/PMCP) with color coding:
  - Green badge for PMCC (bullish)
  - Red badge for PMCP (bearish)
- Correct option type labels (Call vs Put)
- Appropriate emojis (📈 for calls, 📉 for puts)

## 🎯 Strategy Comparison

| Feature | Poor Man's Covered Call (PMCC) | Poor Man's Covered Put (PMCP) |
|---------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Market Outlook** | Bullish | Bearish |
| **Long Position** | Deep ITM LEAP Call (Δ ~0.8) | Deep ITM LEAP Put (Δ ~-0.8) |
| **Short Position** | OTM Short Call (Δ ~0.3) | OTM Short Put (Δ ~-0.3) |
| **Max Profit** | Short Strike - LEAP Strike - Net Debit | Same calculation logic |
| **Ideal Scenario** | Stock rises moderately | Stock falls moderately |
| **Capital Required** | Lower than owning 100 shares | Lower than short selling stock |

## 📋 How to Use

### For Bullish Opportunities (PMCC):
1. Select **"📈 Poor Man's Covered Call (PMCC) - Bullish"** from strategy dropdown
2. Configure filters (LEAPS ITM%, Short OTM%, etc.)
3. Enter bullish symbols (e.g., "NVDA, AMD, TSLA")
4. Click "Scan Opportunities"

### For Bearish Opportunities (PMCP):
1. Select **"📉 Poor Man's Covered Put (PMCP) - Bearish"** from strategy dropdown
2. Configure filters (LEAPS ITM%, Short OTM%, etc.)
3. Enter bearish symbols (e.g., overvalued stocks you expect to decline)
4. Click "Scan Opportunities"

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

1. **Save Filter Test:**
   - Create a filter named "Test PMCP Strategy"
   - Select PMCP strategy type
   - Save filter
   - Reload page and verify it loads with correct strategy

2. **Scan Test:**
   - Use PMCP strategy
   - Enter a symbol with good put options liquidity (e.g., "SPY")
   - Verify results show put options (not calls)
   - Check that deltas are negative

3. **UI Test:**
   - Switch between PMCC and PMCP
   - Verify labels update dynamically
   - Check that strategy description changes

## 📄 Files Modified

1. **templates/index.html**
   - Added prominent strategy selector banner (lines ~63-77)
   - Added dynamic label spans: `<span id="leapsLabel">` and `<span id="shortLabel">`
   - Added `updateStrategyLabels()` JavaScript function
   - Updated `createOpportunityCard()` to display correct option types
   - Removed duplicate strategy selector from parameters section

2. **migration_add_strategy_constraint.sql** (NEW)
   - Added database constraint for valid strategy types
   - Successfully executed

3. **database_schema.sql**
   - Already had constraint defined (for reference)

4. **app.py**
   - No changes needed (already supported both strategies)

---

## 🔒 Database Constraint Verification

```sql
-- Constraint successfully added:
CHECK ((type_of_trade)::text = ANY (
    ARRAY['Poor Mans Covered Call'::character varying, 
          'Poor Mans Covered Put'::character varying]::text[]
))
```

This ensures data integrity - invalid strategy types cannot be saved to the database.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the App:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/herambhathavale/jupyterDir2/Oct-12-2025-Options-Scanner-v2/options-scanner-v2
   source .env
   export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5001
   .venv/bin/python app.py
   ```

2. **Try Both Strategies:**
   - Test PMCC with bullish symbols
   - Test PMCP with bearish symbols
   - Verify results display correctly

3. **Create Sample Filters:**
   - "Conservative PMCC" (lower ROC, higher POP)
   - "Aggressive PMCP" (higher ROC, lower POP)
   - Save and test loading these filters

## 💡 Key Benefits

## 📞 Support Notes

If users encounter issues:
1. Verify they've selected the correct strategy type
2. Ensure filter criteria make sense for the strategy (ITM% for PMCP should be bearish)
3. Check that symbols have liquid put options (for PMCP)
4. Confirm Alpha Vantage API is returning put options data
