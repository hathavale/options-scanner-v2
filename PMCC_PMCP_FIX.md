# PMCC/PMCP Identical Results - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED & FIXED

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
PMCC (Poor Man's Covered Call) and PMCP (Poor Man's Covered Put) were showing identical results because the backend was **ignoring the UI's strategy selection** and always using the database's active filter.

### What Was Happening

1. **User selects strategy in UI** (PMCC or PMCP)
   - UI updates labels dynamically ✅
   - But selection is NOT saved anywhere

2. **User clicks "Scan Opportunities"**
   - Frontend sends: `{symbols: "AAPL"}`
   - Frontend does NOT send strategy type ❌

3. **Backend receives scan request**
   - Backend loads active filter from database
   - Database filter has `type_of_trade = 'Poor Mans Covered Call'` (default)
   - Backend uses this filter, **ignoring UI selection** ❌

4. **Result: Always scans with PMCC**
   - Even when user selected PMCP in UI
   - Both strategies show same (PMCC) results

---

## ✅ The Fix

### Frontend Change (templates/index.html)

**Before:**
```javascript
// Only sent symbols
body: JSON.stringify({symbols: symbols})
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Send symbols AND current filter settings from UI
const filterData = getFilterData();
body: JSON.stringify({
    symbols: symbols,
    filter_criteria: filterData  // ← Now includes type_of_trade!
})
```

### Backend Change (app.py)

**Before:**
```python
# Always used database filter
filter_criteria = get_active_filter()
```

**After:**
```python
# Use filter from request if provided, otherwise use database
filter_criteria = data.get('filter_criteria')
if not filter_criteria:
    filter_criteria = get_active_filter()
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Correct Flow

1. **User selects PMCP in UI**
   - `typeOfTrade` dropdown = "Poor Mans Covered Put"
   - Labels update to "Long Put (LEAPS)" and "Short Put"

2. **User clicks "Scan Opportunities"**
   - `getFilterData()` collects ALL form values including:
     - `type_of_trade: "Poor Mans Covered Put"`
     - All other filter criteria
   - Sends to backend: `{symbols: "AAPL", filter_criteria: {...}}`

3. **Backend receives request**
   - Uses `filter_criteria` from request
   - Passes `type_of_trade="Poor Mans Covered Put"` to scanner
   - Scanner sets `option_type = "put"`
   - Filters for PUT options only

4. **Result: Correct strategy used!**
   - PMCC → Returns call options
   - PMCP → Returns put options

## 📊 Expected Results After Fix

### PMCC Scan (AAPL @ $200)
```
LEAPS:
  Strike: $150 (ITM call, below current)
  Delta: +0.80
  Type: CALL

Short:
  Strike: $210 (OTM call, above current)
  Delta: +0.30
  Type: CALL
```

### PMCP Scan (AAPL @ $200)
```
LEAPS:
  Strike: $250 (ITM put, above current)
  Delta: -0.80
  Type: PUT

Short:
  Strike: $190 (OTM put, below current)
  Delta: -0.30
  Type: PUT
```

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Test Steps

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/options-scanner-v2
   source .env
   export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5001
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Test PMCC:**
   - Open: http://127.0.0.1:5001
   - Select: "Poor Man's Covered Call (PMCC)"
   - Enter: AAPL
   - Click: "Scan Opportunities"
   - **Verify:** Terminal shows `📋 Using strategy: Poor Mans Covered Call`
   - **Verify:** Terminal shows `🎯 Strategy: Poor Mans Covered Call → option_type='call'`
   - **Verify:** Results show call options with strikes below/above current price

3. **Test PMCP:**
   - Select: "Poor Man's Covered Put (PMCP)"
   - Enter: AAPL
   - Click: "Scan Opportunities"
   - **Verify:** Terminal shows `📋 Using strategy: Poor Mans Covered Put`
   - **Verify:** Terminal shows `🎯 Strategy: Poor Mans Covered Put → option_type='put'`
   - **Verify:** Results show put options with strikes above/below current price

4. **Compare Results:**
   - PMCC and PMCP should show DIFFERENT opportunities
   - PMCC should have lower LEAPS strikes (ITM calls)
   - PMCP should have higher LEAPS strikes (ITM puts)

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. templates/index.html
**Lines 443-451** - Updated `scanOpportunities()` function
- Added `getFilterData()` call to collect current UI settings
- Modified request body to include `filter_criteria`
- Now sends strategy type with every scan request

### 2. app.py
**Lines 827-848** - Updated `/api/scan` endpoint
- Added logic to use `filter_criteria` from request
- Falls back to database filter only if not provided
- Updated logging to show strategy being used

## 🔧 Additional Improvements

### Debug Logging Still Active

The debug logs added earlier are still in place and will now show:

```
🎯 Strategy: Poor Mans Covered Put → option_type='put'
🎯 Target deltas: LEAPS=-0.8, SHORT=-0.3
🔍 find_leaps: Looking for option_type='put'
📊 Available options: 2914 calls, 2914 puts
🔍 find_shorts: Looking for option_type='put'
```

This confirms:
1. Correct strategy is being used
2. Both call and put options are available
3. Filtering is working for the correct type

## ✨ Benefits of This Fix

1. **✅ Strategy selection works immediately**
   - No need to save filter first
   - Change strategy and scan right away

2. **✅ UI and backend stay in sync**
   - What you see is what you get
   - Strategy selector directly controls scan behavior

3. **✅ Backward compatible**
   - Still works with saved filters
   - Falls back to database if no criteria provided

4. **✅ More flexible**
   - Can adjust any filter parameter on-the-fly
   - Don't have to save every filter combination
